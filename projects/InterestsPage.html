        <p>
            I’ve been passionate about playing games ever since I was handed down a gameboy when I was a kid. The music, the graphics, the fun that I experienced was unlike any other that I experienced before. Whether I’m playing with friends, watching professional games, or playing by myself, It brings endless entertainment and fun to me.

            One of the reasons I love playing games is the way it enhances your dexterity and hand-eye coordination. Depending on the game you play such as first-person shooters, you can constantly improve, learning new moves, working on your coordination, and developing mental fortitude. Plus, it’s a great way to connect with people.

            It is also a source of entertainment that can destress you in times where you are stressed out. That has been the case for me ever since I was young. If I ever feel stressed. I would play the game that I think can help me. One game that I could think of is Animal Crossing. That game has helped me when the pandemic started and until now.

            It is also filled with a lot of variety. From simple games to complex games. The possibilities are endless.
