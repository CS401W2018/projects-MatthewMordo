        <h2> Introduction:</h2>
        <p>
            I’ve been passionate about playing games ever since I was handed down a Gameboy when I was a kid. The music, the graphics, the fun that I experienced was unlike any other that I had experienced before. Whether I’m playing with friends, watching professional games, or playing by myself, it brings endless entertainment and fun to me.

            One of the reasons I love playing games is the way it enhances your dexterity and hand-eye coordination. Depending on the game you play, such as first-person shooters, you can constantly improve, learn new moves, work on your coordination, and develop mental fortitude. Plus, it’s a great way to <span class="highlight">connect</span> with people.

            It is also a source of entertainment that can destress you during stressful times. This has been the case for me ever since I was young. If I ever feel stressed, I play the game I think can help me. One game that I think of is Animal Crossing, which helped me when the pandemic started and continues to help me now.

        <p>
            It is also filled with a lot of variety, from simple games to complex games. The possibilities are endless.
