        <!-- Paragraph about the hero -->
        <p>
            Shigeru Miyamoto is a video game designer and producer, widely considered one of the most influential figures in the gaming industry. He is the mind behind some of the most iconic franchises, such as <span class="super">"Super Mario,"</span> <span class="zelda">"The Legend of Zelda,"</span> and <span class="kong">"Donkey Kong."</span> His work has shaped the industry and brought joy to millions of players worldwide.

            He is also my inspiration on why I am fascinated with games today and why I am very interested in making games in the future. There are a lot of gaming companies that make tons of games. But Miyamoto and his company are the ones that are stuck in my mind and remain an inspiration to me.
