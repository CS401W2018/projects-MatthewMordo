        <h1>What is the difference between a block and an inline tag? Give examples of each one.</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Block Tags:</strong> elements take up the full width available and start on a new line. Examples include div, h1, p, and section.</li>
                <li><strong>Inline Tags:</strong> These elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not start on a new line. Examples include span, a, img, and strong.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>What is normal flow in HTML?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Normal flow refers to the default layout of elements in a web page, where block-level elements stack vertically and inline elements sit next to each other horizontally. In normal flow, the browser lays out elements in the order they appear in the HTML document.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>What does float do? Why do you need to clear the float?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Float:</strong> The float property allows elements to be taken out of the normal flow and positioned to the left or right of their container. Text and inline elements will then wrap around the floated element.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Float:</strong> Clearing a float is necessary to ensure that containers wrap around floated elements properly. If you donâ€™t clear the float, parent elements may collapse in height because they don't account for the floated children.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>What do absolute, fixed, and relative do?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Absolute Positioning:</strong> Positions an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). If no such ancestor exists, it uses the document body.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed Positioning:</strong> Positions an element relative to the viewport, meaning it stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.</li>
                <li><strong>Relative Positioning:</strong> Positions an element relative to its normal position in the flow. It allows for slight adjustments using top, right, bottom, and left properties without affecting the layout of surrounding elements.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>How can you make nice navigation buttons for mobile devices?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Use a responsive design framework like Bootstrap or Flexbox for flexibility.</li>
                <li>Ensure buttons are large enough for easy tapping (at least 44x44 pixels).</li>
                <li>Use clear, contrasting colors and readable fonts.</li>
                <li>Add hover and active states for interactivity.</li>
                <li>Consider using icons alongside text for better visual appeal.</li>
            </ul>

        <h1>Where can you find videos to review what we talked about in class?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>You can find review videos on platforms like YouTube, educational websites like Khan Academy or Coursera, or by checking resources linked to your class materials, such as learning management systems (LMS) or specific course websites. Your instructor may also provide a list of recommended resources.</li>
            </ul>
