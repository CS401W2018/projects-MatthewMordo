        <h1>Explain the difference between inline, embedded, and external CSS.</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p> Inline CSS is directly in an HTML file using the "Style" Attribute. </p>
            <p> Embedded CSS is inside a "style" and "head" section of an HTML document.</p>
            <p> External CSS is in a separate ".css" file linked via a "link" tag in the "head"</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>Explain why you should only use external CSS.</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p> <strong>Clarity: </strong>Keeping HTML and CSS separate makes the code easier to read and maintain. HTML handles structure, while CSS handles presentation. </p>
            <p> <strong>Multiple Pages:</strong> You can link the same CSS file to multiple HTML documents, ensuring consistent styling across an entire website without duplicating code.</p>
            <p> <strong>Caching:</strong> Browsers cache external CSS files, which can speed up page load times on subsequent visits, as the styles donâ€™t need to be downloaded again.</p>

        <h1>What is a selector used for?</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p> A selector in CSS is used to target HTML elements that you want to style. It defines which elements the styles will apply to. Here are the main purposes and types of selectors: </p>
            <h2>Purpose of Selectors:</h2>
            <p><strong>Targeting Elements: </strong> specify which HTML elements to style based on their type, class, ID, attributes, and more.</p>
            <p><strong>Applying Styles: </strong> an element is targeted, the corresponding CSS rules are applied to modify its appearance (e.g., color, font, layout). </p>
