        <h2>What is the difference between block tags and inline tags.</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <li><strong>Block Tags:</strong> These elements take up the full width available, creating a new line before and after the element. They are typically used for larger content sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Inline Tags:</strong> These elements only take up as much width as necessary and do not create a new line. They are often used for smaller pieces of content within block elements.</li>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>What is the margin, border, and padding?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <li><strong>Margin:</strong> The space outside an element's border. It creates space between the element and other elements around it. Margins can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left).</li>
            <li><strong>Border:</strong> A line that goes around an element, defined by its thickness, style, and color. Borders are part of the box model and can be customized in various ways.</li>
            <li><strong>Padding:</strong> The space between an element's content and its border. Padding creates space inside the element itself. Like margins, padding can also be set individually for each side.</li>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>What are units of measurement you can use in CSS?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <h3>Absolute units:</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <li><strong>Pixels:</strong> A fixed unit, commonly used for precise sizing.</li>
                <li><strong>Centimeters:</strong> Generally used for print styles.</li>
                <li><strong>Inches:</strong> Also used for print.</li>

        <h2>When would you use a figure tag?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            You would use the figure tag when you want to semantically group media content (like images, illustrations, or diagrams) with an optional caption. This is useful for:
            <blockquote>
                <li>Improving accessibility by clarifying the relationship between the media and its description.</li>
                <li>Enhancing the structure of your HTML, making it clear that the content is a standalone reference.</li>
                <li>Allowing for easier styling and layout adjustments for media content.</li>
