<h2>What are special entity characters? </h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>special entity characters are used to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML or that might otherwise be difficult to include in the markup directly. These entities start with an ampersand (&) and end with a semicolon (;). Here are a few examples:
        <ul>
            <li> &amplt; for  (less than) </li>
            <li> &ampgt; for > (greater than)</li> 
            <li> &ampamp; for &</li>
            <li> &ampquot; for "</li>
            <li> &ampapos; for '</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

<h2>What is the difference between OL and UL Tags?</h2>
    <blockquote>
    <p>The &lt;ol&gt;(OrderedList) and &lt;ul&gt;(Unordered List) tags are used to create lists in HTML. But they serve different functions and purposes</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
    <p>&lt;ol&gt;(OrderedList) is used to list where the order of the items is important.</p>
    <p>  Use &lt;ol&gt; when you want to present items in no particular order, such as a list of features or a collection of items.</p>
