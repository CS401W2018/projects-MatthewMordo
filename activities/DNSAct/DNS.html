        <h2>What is DNS?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>DNS (Domain Name System) is like the phonebook of the internet. It translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses (e.g., 192.168.1.1) that computers use to identify each other on the network. Without DNS, you'd need to remember long strings of numbers instead of easy-to-remember domain names.  </li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How do you get a domain name?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Firstly, come up with a domain name, then using domain name registrars such as GoDaddy to see if the domain name you want is available.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>What is SSL?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>You can get an SSL certificate from a trusted provider (e.g., Letâ€™s Encrypt, Comodo, DigiCert). On your server, generate a CSR, which contains your domain and company details. Submit this CSR to the certificate authority (CA) for verification and once the certificate is issued, you need to install it on your web server. The installation process varies depending on your hosting provider or server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx).</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How do you get a security certificate?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>To get an SSL certificate, you choose a certificate provider, generate a CSR (Certificate Signing Request), submit it to the provider for verification, and then install the issued certificate on your web server.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How does SSL work?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>SSL secures online communication by encrypting data between a server and browser, while staying safe online involves using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping software updated, avoiding phishing, and using tools like VPNs for privacy.</li>
            </ul>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How do you stay safe online.</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <ul>
                <li>Staying safe online involves using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping software updated, avoiding public Wi-Fi for sensitive tasks, being cautious of phishing, and using tools like VPNs for added security and privacy.</li>
            </ul>
