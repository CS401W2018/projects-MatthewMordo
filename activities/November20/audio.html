        <h2>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>In CSS, the transform property is used to modify the position, size, and shape of an element. It allows you to apply 2D and 3D transformations, such as rotating, scaling, translating, and skewing an element, without affecting its layout in the document.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2>How do you stay safe online?</h2>
        <blockquote>
            <p>Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Avoid using easily guessable passwords. Utilize a password manager to generate and store secure passwords for different accounts.</p>
            <p>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): This adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., SMS code or app-generated code).</p>
            <p>Beware of Phishing Scams: Don’t click on suspicious links in emails or text messages. Always verify the sender’s identity before responding.</p>
            <p>Keep Software Updated: Install updates for your operating system, apps, and security software regularly to protect against vulnerabilities.</p>
        </blockquote>
