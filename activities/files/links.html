        <br>3 Rules with relative links
        <blockquote>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>  . Current Folder (Not used)</li>
                <li> .. Parent Folder</li>
                <li> /at beginning/ start at the root</li>
            </ol>
        </blockquote>
        <h1>Do links need to be inside the NAV tag?</h1>
        <p>NOT all links of a document should be inside a <strong>nav</strong> element. The <strong>nav</strong> element is intended only for major blocks of navigation links.</p>
        <h1>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h1>
        <p>An <strong>absolute link (or absolute URL)</strong> provides the full web address needed to access a resource, regardless of where the link is being referenced from.</p>
        <p>A <strong>relative link</strong> gives the location of a resource relative to the current page or the site’s root. It doesn’t include the full web address, so the link is determined based on the page from which it's called.</p>
        <h1>Why relative links?</h1>
        <p>Relative links are easier to manage within a site because they continue to work if the domain changes, as long as the internal structure stays the same. They're also more portable, making it easy to move a site to different servers without updating the links. Additionally, relative links are shorter and quicker to type or update compared to absolute links.</p>
