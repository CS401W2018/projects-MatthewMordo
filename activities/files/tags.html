    <p><strong>President Nelson said year 1985:</strong>
        <blockquote>
            “We are free to think. We are free to plan. And then we are free to do. But once an action has been taken, we are never free from its consequences. Those considering abortion have already exercised certain choices.” (“Reverence for Life,” April 1985)

    <p><strong>President Kauwe said:</strong></p>
        <blockquote>
            You think about the love that we’re asked to have for one another and the concept of Hawaiian aloha are one and the same. 
            You come to this community that’s been based on that <mark><u>aloha spirit.</u></mark> 
            And you think about it, and you talk about it, and you hear that word. 
            And it means something, and it changes the way you think, the way that you view yourself and the people around you. 
            So it reminds you of the love that you should have. 
            And so for us, the mission is to bring those students who are doing wonderful things, who are stalwart, and give them that capstone experience where they become the spiritual and intellectual leaders that can change their communities, their families, and really, really make a difference.
